# python-word-and-reading-time-count
Word &amp; Reading Time Counter is a simple Python-based CLI application that counts the number of words in a text input and estimates the time required to read it based on an average reading speed.  This project is a practical example of basic string manipulation, command-line input handling, and unit testing in Python.
